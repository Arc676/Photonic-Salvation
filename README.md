# Photonic Salvation

Someone left all the lights on! Turn off all the lights before you go to bed in this procedurally generated, first person game with an overly dramatic title.

## Gameplay

WASD to move. Use the mouse to look around. Click on the lights while looking at them to turn them on or off. Press spacebar to toggle your flashlight.

Your objective is to turn off all the lights and return to the floor with your bed in as little time as possible. Time spent with your flashlight on counts against your score. See in-game instructions for more details.
